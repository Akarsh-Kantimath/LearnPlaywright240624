In the playwright.config.js file inside use : block, add screenshot and trace parameter
use : {  
    browserName : 'chromium', 
    screenshot : 'on',
    trace : 'on',
    headless : false,

  },

  -->Upon run of any spec file, two folders are automatically created 
  1. test-results - contains trace.zip file
  2. playwright-report - index.html right click and choose the copyPath and paste in the browser to open the report of pass and fail or falky

to open trace.zip file to see the screenshots of ongoing test
1. go to trace.playwright.dev site in the browser
2. search of test-results folder through file manager and open it to see the screenshots of the test spec files

-----------------------------------------------
When there are multiple spec files, if we keep generating trace file for every passed or failed spec file, then it eats up the memory of the system.
To avoid it, we can generate trace file of only failed tests. 
In playwright.config.js file, we will change the trace parameter value from 
trace : 'on', -> trace : 'retain-on-failure'
