//npx playwright test --> npx does the job of finding playwright jar inside node_modules
// and test here refers to execute test runner i.e. playwright.config.js inside of it testDir - test directory files
//inside tests folder - it checks for how many annotations are there inside a spec file
//it will execute the multiple test annotations in a file sequentially

//For example, if you have a test file named example.spec.ts located in the tests directory, you would run: npx playwright test tests/example.spec.ts

//By deafult playwright executes in headless mode - npx playwright test tests/8.BrowserContextAndPageFixtures.spec.js  
//To run them in headed mode - npx playwright test tests/8.BrowserContextAndPageFixtures.spec.js --headed

//when you want to particular test annotation to be run only then we can use .only after the test annotation 
//test.only
